## Introduction
I am currently in transition to civilian life from active duty Air Force.  I am attending the CNM Java +Android deep dive boot camp as part of the Department of Defense Skill Bridge program.  

I have been in Albuquerque for 2 years.  From 2019 to 2020 I managed unit level programs such as security clearances and finances to member fitness.  From 2020 to present I directed unit maintenance operations for 200+ personnel and 3 airframes.

I have an AS in Nondestructive Technology, a BS in Digital Media & Web Technology and pursuing a Masters in Business Management which has been paused for this course.
